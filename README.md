# Shulker Box Slot

Shulker Box Slot is a mod that uses Curios API/Trinkets API to add a new slot, the Back slot to the player inventory and
allows shulker boxes to be placed into this slot. While a shulker box is in this slot, the player can use a keybinding,
default 'X', to directly access its contents. This allows the player to interact with a shulker box's contents more
freely and easily without the need to place it down, to sacrifice an inventory slot to keep it around, or to need to
search through a player's inventory for the box.
